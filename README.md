# Competetive Programming
I have created this repo to keep track of the daily progress and to be regular at competitive programming.
The questions that I have solved here was found on the YouTube channel - Love Babbar and I will update the complete list, once I am done solving them. :innocent:

## Array :

- [X] 1. [Reverse the array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)
- [X] 2. [Find the maximum and minimum element in an array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-and-minimum-in-an-array/)
- [X] 3. [Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-smallest-element/0)
- [X] 4. [Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1)
- [X] 5. [Move all the negative elements to one side of the array.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-negative-numbers-beginning-positive-end-constant-extra-space/)
- [X] 6. [Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/union-of-two-arrays/0)
- [X] 7. [Write a program to cyclically rotate an array by one.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cyclically-rotate-an-array-by-one/0)
- [] 8. [Find Largest sum contiguous Subarray](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kadanes-algorithm/0) :fire:
- [ ] 9. [Minimise the maximum difference between heights](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-the-heights3351/1) :fire:
- [ ] 10. [Minimum no. of Jumps to reach end of an array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-number-of-jumps/0)
