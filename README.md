# Competetive Programming
I have created this repo to keep track of the daily progress and to be regular at competitive programming.
The questions that I have solved here was found on the YouTube channel - Love Babbar and I will update the complete list, once I am done solving them. :innocent:

- [ ] 1. [Reverse the array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/)
- [ ] 2. [Find the maximum and minimum element in an array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-and-minimum-in-an-array/)
- [ ] 3. [Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-smallest-element/0)
- [ ] 4. [Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo.](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1)
